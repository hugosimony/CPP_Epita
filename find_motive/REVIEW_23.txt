Architecture ok.
Code compiling well.
Motive search is good.

All the 'using' are weird, not needed as you write them fully in the code. Not a big deal anyway.

Exception of bad file handled. :)
Exception of same motive in the word not handled. :(
(That's ok)

Good use of find() and push_back().
Nice idea to use a vector dynamically.

The output is as it should be.

Great work!
